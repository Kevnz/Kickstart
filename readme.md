## Kickstart

Kickstart is a simple Node.js module that creates a folder structure and adds files needed to get up and running quickly. Heavily inspired by the command line options in express, Kickstart creates a new project with some folder structure as well as jade templates and already including YUI in the frontend code and styling inspired by [Tilo Mitra] and his [YUI CSS Common] project

## Install
```
$ npm install kickstart-ex
```

## Usage
```
$ kickstart myapp
$ cd myapp
$ npm install
```

This will give you a new express app with a styled layout and your first route.
